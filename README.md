# Portfolio as part of my training
## Immo Eliza
First project in solo to learn ML Regressor, with a dataset scrapped in group on Immoweb.be and ImmoVlan.be :
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Using KNN Imputer
- Using XGBoostRegressor

We can predict a price of a house or an apartment in Belgium with a accuracy of 87%.

A lighter version of this model is implemented on group project "3D House", whose design an building by raster dataset (DTM + DSM) and predict price.
